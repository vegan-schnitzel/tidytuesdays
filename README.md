# #TidyTuesday

The TidyTuesday challenge evolved around the [R4DS learning community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/), essentially,
it's all about the visualization of various datasets utilizing the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
collection of R packages. Since 2018, every tuesday, a (new) dataset is selected and motivated nerds
create & share many different depictions of it.

Further information and the current (as well as archived) data can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
